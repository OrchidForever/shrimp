Superhero data that needs to be displayed for the world!

## Starting the program

After cloning, please run `npm install` and then you are able to run with `npm start`

The project uses the following libraries:
- MaterialUI
- Typescript
- Axios

## Testing

No tests for this short little project. Why? Time. Quiet honestly, I spent more time of this than I wanted.

I do not write tests for components, just util files. 
I do write Cypress tests for the front end e2e testing.

## What I would do if I had more time

- Write tests. This was quick and dirty.
- More styling. I am bothered by the styling. 
- Fix the images in the cards to be more centered.
- More info in the list? Too much white space.
- Padgentation/Infinite Scroll on the list and grid
- Static tabs, I dislike they scroll away. 
- Darkview, too much white
